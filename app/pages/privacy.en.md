# Privacy Policy

This is a very rudimentary privacy policy intended only to cover the mailing list signup.

Typically a project at such an early stage as this one would gloss over a detail like this, but I know how much we care about compliance in this movement, so I've gone to the extra trouble.

It probably won't be feasible to describe the privacy minutiae of future features in this level of detail, so expect the next iteration of this to zoom out considerably.
