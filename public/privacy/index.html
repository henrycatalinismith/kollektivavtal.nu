<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This is a very rudimentary privacy policy intended only to cover the mailing list signup.</p>
<p>Typically a project at such an early stage as this one would gloss over a detail like this but I know how much we care about compliance in this movement so I've gone to the extra trouble.</p>
<p>It probably won't be feasible to describe the privacy minutiae of future features in this level of detail so expect the next iteration of this to zoom out considerably.</p>
